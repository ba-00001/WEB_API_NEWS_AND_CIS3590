        <div class="intro">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                In my pursuit of the Panther Career Readiness Micro-Credential, I have enhanced my professional competencies and developed valuable skills that I am eager to apply in my career.

        <h3>NACE Competencies and Examples</h3>
        
        <h4>Communication</h4>
        <p>
            Through my internship at [Company/Organization], I honed my written and verbal communication skills, especially in conveying technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. For instance, I presented a project summary to the executive team, ensuring that my explanations were accessible and clear to those without technical backgrounds.
        </p>

        <h4>Critical Thinking/Problem Solving</h4>
        <p>
            My role as a Teaching Assistant for CodePath taught me the importance of critical thinking in technical interview prep. I helped students troubleshoot coding issues, encouraged them to analyze problems systematically, and guided them through possible solutions. This experience strengthened my own analytical skills, which I applied to improve problem-solving efficiency.
        </p>

        <h4>Technology</h4>
        <p>
            In developing the HealthWatch app, I learned to integrate APIs and use technologies such as Python and Flask, which enhanced my technical expertise. This hands-on project deepened my understanding of real-time data processing, preparing me to handle complex technical tasks in a professional setting.
        </p>

        <h4>Teamwork/Collaboration</h4>
        <p>
            My involvement with Code Crunch, where I organized panel discussions and worked with industry experts, helped me improve my teamwork skills. Working in a team, I learned how to build consensus, manage differing viewpoints, and contribute constructively to achieve shared objectives.
        </p>
